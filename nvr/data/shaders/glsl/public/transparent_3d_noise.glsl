    Transparent 3D Noise
	--------------------

	On occasion, I use this simple transparent setup to visualize certain 3D algorithms.
	Obviously, it wouldn't pass for proper transparency, but to be fair, it's not running 
	at minus 2 frames per second either. :)

	Here, it's being used to render stock standard, smooth, 3D value noise.

	I'm using a variation on IQ's textureless version. It does the same thing, but is 
	written in a more succinct, self contained form. I couldn't say whether it's faster 
	or not (probably not), but it's faster to cut and paste, so that's almost the same 
	thing. :)

	Seriously, though, it's reasonably quick, but I'm hoping some clever soul might know 
	of a way to improve it.

	IQ's really fast, textureless version is there as well, but it's commented out. If 
	you require more speed, that's the one to use.

	In regards to the transparency itself, there are a bunch of variables that effect the
	overall look. Too many to mention, in fact. The easiest way to get accustomed to
	them all is to change them and see what happens.

// it's still no match for IQ's texture-based, smooth 3D value noise.
