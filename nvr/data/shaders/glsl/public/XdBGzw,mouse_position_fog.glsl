// Name: Mouse position fog
// Description: My first shader, written in 2011-10-23. I tried porting it to Shadertoy, but at the time it did not support extra buffers. On 2016-04-26, I've updated this shader to make it work in Shadertoy. This would look much cooler if there was mouse-over support.

	vec2 uv = fragCoord.xy / iResolution.xy;
	fragColor = texture2D(iChannel0, uv);
